List of relationships that need to be crunched/established:

ALL
-Integrate geographic data into tables
-Identify interesting trends via data exploration
-Support trends with statistical models
-Graph/chart the strongest ones
-Select 3 for blog post
-Compile all into presentation
-BONUS: do your sample selection bias study.

-See if there's a better way to quickly display and compare charts.
	-Create a dataframe with all the series you want to display
	-in pandas use (subplots=True) and then determine layout and everything else.


Encenillo
-height over time
-DAB over time
-health over time
-mortality over time
-resiembras over time
-species height, DAB, health vs location per time
	-try to take into account replants

Bojaca
-Remove worst performers for mortality
-do the species/mod plots for Pe√±as, as well as T2 and T3 for Esmeralda.
	-Esmeralda species that show promise: Baccharis latifolia, Croton magdalenensis, Lupinus interruptus, Morella pubescens, Quercus humboldtii, Solanum oblongifolium, Verbesina nudipes?, Viburnum tinoides.

-Group plots by potrero, fringes, arrange them to see if there's some kind of visible relationship
	-If not, see if you can find some other explanation. There really does seem to be some kind.
-Plot mortality by species/mod for E and P
