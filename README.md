The analysis of data from a medium-scale ecological restoration project in Colombia.

The jupyter notebook contains detailed comments explaining what I've done, including a full analysis of the results at the end.

Check out the medium post that this produced: https://medium.com/@f.vasquez.tavera/data-science-and-ecological-restoration-4-steps-to-action-with-a-real-life-case-study-e5003578b082

The motivation for this project was a combination of wanting to improve my python and data science skills, as well as to provide actionable analysis on a growing pile of data from my job at the time. While this started as an academic exercise, management became interested and the scope of the project increased. The branch "Spanish" contains the full extent of the project, while the branch "main" contains the much more polished highlights for an english-speaking audience unfamiliar with ecological restoration.

Project done entirely in Python. Libraries used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Acknowledgements:
Many thanks to the team I work with at Fundacion Natura, especially to Oriana for showing interest and allowing me to use this data, and to Vivi for all of the useful feedback. Without them this would be a boring boilerplate data project with nothing applicable to show for it.

Also thanks to the hardworking people that collected the data painstakingly by hand: Martha, Wilmer, Brian, Johanna, Vivi, Jessica, Nestor, Edinson, myself, and additional helpers.
